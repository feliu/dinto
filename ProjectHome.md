# Overview #

**DINTO** is an OWL ontology that systematically organizes all drug-drug interaction (DDI) related information.

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) form a significant risk group for adverse effects associated with pharmaceutical treatment. These interactions are often reported in the literature, however, they are sparsely represented in machine-readable resources, such as online databases, thesauri or ontologies. **DINTO** is an ontology that describes and categorizes DDIs and all the possible mechanisms that can lead to them (including both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic DDI mechanisms).

**DINTO** can be combined with specifically created Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules to infer DDIs and their different mechanisms (both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic). To demonstrate it, we have conducted different experiments that are described in _Herrero-Zazo, María; Segura-Bedmar, Isabel; Hastings, Janna; Martínez, Paloma (2015). [DINTO: Using OWL ontologies and SWRL rules to infer drug-drug interactions and their mechanisms.](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00119) Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling. Just Accepted Manuscript._ DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00119

The application of **DINTO** to different natural language tasks – i.e., drug named entity recognition (NER) and DDI relation extraction (RE) – is described in _Herrero-Zazo, María; Segura-Bedmar, Isabel; Hastings, Janna; Martínez, Paloma (2015). [Application of Domain Ontologies to Natural Language Processing: A Case Study for Drug-Drug Interactions.](http://www.igi-global.com/article/application-of-domain-ontologies-to-natural-language-processing/132500/) (2015) International Journal of Information Retrieval Research (IJIRR). 5(3), 19-38._

A detailed description of **DINTO**, the methodology followed for its construction and evaluation, and the different application scenarios where it has been used can be found in the PhD Dissertation _[http://labda.inf.uc3m.es/doku.php?id=es:labda_asignacion_tesis/ Semantic Resources in Pharmacovigilance: a Corpus and an Ontology for Drug-Drug Interactions (2015). Herrero-Zazo, María. Universidad Carlos III de Madrid._

First steps in the creation of **DINTO** are described in _Herrero-Zazo, María; Hastings, Janna; Segura-Bedmar, Isabel; Croset, Samuel; Martínez, Paloma; Steinbeck, Christoph (2013) [An ontology for drug-drug interactions.](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1114/) 6th International Workshop on Semantic Web Applications and Tools for Life Sciences (SWAT4LS) Edinburgh, UK._
